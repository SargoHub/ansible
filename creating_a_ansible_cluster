create 3 instances, one master and 2 slaves
on master install ansible 

configure password-less ssh connection between master and slave
once done

on master go to cd /etc/ansible
sudo nano hosts , here add the 
[slave1] 
it's private IP
[slave2]  
its priv IP

create a playbook.yaml
- name: task for slave1
  hosts: slave1
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: install java
     apt: name=openjdk-11-jdk state=latest
- name: task for slave2
  hosts: slave2
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: install sql
     apt:


to run the playbook
ansible-playbook play1.yaml --check     THIS IS FOR DRY RUN
ansible-playbook play1.yaml     THIS IS TO RUN THE PLAYBOOK

    


TO CREATE ANSIBLE ROLE
sudo ansible-galaxy init apache
sudo ansible-galaxy init nginx

This will create two roles folders, there will be sub folders,
for any one role
go inside the tasks folder
there will be a main.yaml     THE ROLE RUNS THIS YAML ONLY
so we create a new yaml, sample.yaml ( put the tasks here)
    go inside the main.yaml  
    ---
    - include_tasks: sample.yaml

now do the same for the other role

now create a playbook, where we call these roles
- name: execute apache
  hosts: slave1
  become: true
  roles:
   - apache
- name: execute apache
  hosts: slave2
  become: true
  roles:
   - nginx        
run this playbook now, ansible-playbook play1.yaml
